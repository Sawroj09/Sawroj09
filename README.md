I am working as a department minister for the College of International Education Center Group (CIECG) at NUAA. I love to do computer-aided design (CAD)-based work. I am still learning and improving my skills. I have beginning-level knowledge of SolidWorks, CATIA, and AutoCAD 2D. I did a few group projects. I also have basic knowledge of MATLAB, C and Java programming languages.
